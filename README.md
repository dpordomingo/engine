## Introduction

source{d} Engine exposes powerful [Universal ASTs](#babelfish-uast) to analyze your code and a SQL engine to analyze your git history:

- **Code Processing**: use git repositories as a dataset.
- **Language-Agnostic Code Analysis**: automatically identify languages, parse source code, and extract the pieces that matter with language-independent queries.
- **Git Analysis**: powerful SQL based analysis on top of your git repositories.
- **Querying With Familiar APIs**: analyze your code through powerful friendly APIs, such as SQL, gRPC, and various client libraries.

This repository contains the code of **source{d} Engine** and the project documentation, which you can also see properly rendered at [docs.sourced.tech/engine](https://docs.sourced.tech/engine).

Currently, **source{d} Lookout** is in development process.

## Quick Start

source{d} Engine supports Linux, macOS and Windows.

You will find in the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md) all the steps to get started with source{d} Engine, from the installation of its dependencies, to running SQL queries to inspect git repositories.

## Architecture

_For more details on the architecture of this project, read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)._

source{d} Engine functions as a command-line interface tool that provides easy access to components of source{d} stack for Code As Data.

It consists of a daemon managing all of the services, which are packaged as Docker containers:

- [enry](https://github.com/src-d/enry): language classifier
- [babelfish](https://doc.bblf.sh): universal code parser
  - [daemon](https://github.com/bblfsh/bblfshd): Babelfish server
  - [language drivers](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adriver+org%3Abblfsh&type=Repositories): parsers + normalizers for programming languages
  - [babelfish-web](https://github.com/bblfsh/web): web client for Babelfish server
- [gitbase](https://github.com/src-d/gitbase): SQL database interface to Git repositories
  - [gitbase-web](https://github.com/src-d/gitbase-web): web client for gitbase
